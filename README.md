# TSIC_Color_Models
An original project I conducted examining the effects of different color models on convolutional neural networks and their ability to classify images of traffic signs.

This project's code implements the algorithm and its associated experimental procedure used for the study I conducted.

The CURE-TSR image dataset involved in this study can be downloaded at https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/cure-tsr-challenging-unreal-and-real-environments-traffic-sign-recognition
It has been made public by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Their repository can be found here: https://github.com/olivesgatech/CURE-TSR
